Important Development Notes :

-> Carousel Functionality: Please implement the carousel functionality using
Swiper.js. Your ability to integrate third-party libraries is part of this
test.

-> CSS Units: We recommend the use of em/rem units in CSS for better
scalability and responsiveness. This practice is optional but valued.

-> Mobile Responsiveness: It's imperative that the webpage is
mobile-responsive. This is a crucial aspect of modern web development that
we'll be evaluating.

-> Top Carousel Section:
For this section, ensure users can interact seamlessly with the carousel by
using navigation dots. Additionally, enable an autoplay feature to make it
engaging.

-> Card Slider:
The card slider should offer a smooth user experience. Users should be able
to drag the slider using both mouse and touch gestures.

-> Statistics Section:
Bring the statistics to life by incorporating a counting or ticker
animation. Numbers should animate from 0 to the desired values.

-> FAQ Section:
Users should have a user-friendly experience accessing answers. By clicking
the plus icon next to a question, only one answer should be visible at a
time.
